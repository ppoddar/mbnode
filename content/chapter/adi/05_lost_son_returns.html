After Ganga left him, Shantanu continued his reign. He was sad. Yet he remained a
 just ruler and spent his days free of lust or anger. 
   <br>
 After many years Ganga had left him, once Shantanu reached the riverbank chasing a deer on a hunt. 
 He noticed a  tall, angelic boy was shooting arrows on the riverbank. The boy shot so rapidly that the
 sky was almost covered. Shantanu was impressed, but the boy soon disappeared. 
  <br>
 The mysterious boy reminded Shantanu of his own son whom he had never met since birth.
      <br>
 The old king prayed to the river: "O beloved Ganga, please let me see my son". 
 Ganga, ageless and beautiful, emerged from the river in a white dress. The same tall boy was at
 her side.    
   <br>
 She was overwhelmed, too: 
 "Oh my dear king, let me present you our son - <em>Debabrata</em></span>". 
   I have raised him worthy to be an emperor.
 He had studied Vedas under <em>Vashishta</em>.
 He has mastered all the scriptures known to <em>Shukra</em>Â 
 and <em>BrihashPati</span>.
 He mastered all the weapons known to 
 <em>Yamadagnya</em>. 
 Please accept this great
 warrior, this royal boy, under your wings".
