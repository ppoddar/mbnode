  Ganga narrated the story of OctoBasu's and their curse:

 
  <div class="story">
  Once OctoBasus and their wives went on a vacation to 
  <span class="glossary">Sumeru</span>
  mountain near Saint <span class="glossary">Vashistha</span>'s meditation retreat. 
  <br>
  The wife of <span class="glossary">DuyBasu</span> - one of the OctoBasus - 
  saw <span class="glossary">Nandini</span> - the
  amazing cow that granted every wish of its owner - grazing on the campus. 
  <br>
  DuyBasu's wife liked the cow so much that she must gift it to her friend
  <span class="glossary">Jitabati</span>.
  <br>    
  She insisted husband so much that finally DuyBasu had to steal the cow. 
  <em>Since that time, no husband has ever been able to ignore his wife's demand</em>
  <br>
  Saint Vashishta was not present 
  at the campus at that time. But once he returned and found theÂ cow missing, he was
  furious. 
  <br>
  He cursed: "Whoever has stolen my Nandini will be born as human".
   <br>
  OctoBasu apologized and begged Saint Vashishta to retract his curse. 
   <br>
  Vashishta calmed down a bit: "OK, you will be free of the curse within an year".
   
  <br>
  "But not him": Vashishta said, pointing at DuyBasu: 
  "He must serve the sentence of a <em>full</em> human life. 
  But... it will be a pious life of a wise man who would be dear to his father
  and free of sexual temptation".
</div> 
 
 
 <p>
 After narrating the tale of
 of OctoBasus, Ganga told Shantanu: "O my beloved king, I had thrown the newborns
 to the river every time because they were OctoBasus reincarnated, 
 and they wished to return to heaven as
 soon as possible. 
 But this eighth newborn is DuyBasu - he must live a human man life 
 before he can reenter heaven". 
   <br>
 Then she took the newborn with her and disappeared into Ganga - her own river.
