Pandu went on a campaign with army and returned with
conquest. He donated the conquered wealth to Vishma, his tow mothers and Vidur. 
  <br>
 One day, Pandu went to hunt and killed a deer while it was copulating.
 <br>
The wounded deer said: "Not even the worst criminal will kill a copulating deer!
I am saint <em>Kimindam</em>, I was in an intercourse with my wife in the
form of a deer for begetting a son. 
You were not aware that I am a Bramhin, so you would not be guilty
of killing a Bramhin. But I curse you: you too will die during intercourse."
  <br>
Cursed Paudu wailed and said: "I would become a monk and an ascetic. I can not father
a child anymore due to the curse, I will stop being a family man". 
  <br>
Kunti and Madri, his queens, said:"We are your lawful wives. We will follow you and 
curb our amorous desires and mediadate with you".
    <br>
Then Pandu and his wives donated their possessions to bramhins and went to the forest
to spend ascetic life.
<br>
Pandu with his two wives mediated at <em>Shatashringa</em> peak 
crossing <em>Nagshat</em>, <em>Chaitrarath</em>,
<em>Kalkut</em>, <em>Gandhamadan</em> mountains and lake <em>Indradunmya</em>
in the northern Himalaya range. He became friends to many <em>rishis</em>. 
<br>
One day the rishis said: "We are meeting Bramha in a conference in the  heaven".
When Pandu wanted to join them with his wives, they declined: "Those heavnly
abodes are difficul to reach. You can not reach there with your queens."
<br>
Pandu said:"I am childless. The doors of heaven is closed for me. That is why I wanted
to join you. I am free of debts from gods, rishis or men by rituals, scholarship and kindness.
But can not free myself of debts to me forefathers by begetting a child. Please suggest 
a way so that my wives can bear children in their wombs.". The rishis said:"Oh King, we 
can foresee that you will beget angelic sons."
<br>
Pandu told Kunti in private: "You try to beget a child. An woman can beget a son from 
men of higher caste or brother-in-law if required". Kunti said:"I have heard the queen
of <em>Bushitashya</em> begot a son after she had an intercourse with his dead husband 
after he died out of tuberoculosis. You too can get me a son inn my womb by meditative
power".
<br>
Pandu replied: "Bushitashya was god-like, strong. I am not that powerful. I am telling you
from the ancient scriptures. The women were free. They used to be with other men leaving
their own husband. There was no harm in that. Such was the old practices. The northern folks
still follow these customs. Even those customs were not prohibited since long. <em>Uddalak</em> 
was a saint. His sone was <em>Shetketu</em>. Onec Shetketu saw a brmhin taking his mother 
away in front of his father. Uddalak told Shetketu: Do not get angry. This is Sanatan Dharma.
All women are free like cows. Shetketu was pissed off. All women, from today, who will go 
with other men, all men who will mate other woman ignoring their own loya wife and the woman
who will deny to bore child by surrogate  father, all of them will be guilty of infanticide.
Kunti, you know that I was born because of Krishna Dwaipayan. I want a  son. I beseech you to 
beget a son from some bramhin "
<br>
Kunti told Pandu abou Durbasha's mantra. "If you permit, I can invite a god or a bramhin
by the power of the mantra. The god will beget a son  quickly. By a bramhin will take longer"
<br>
Pandu said:"I am pleased. You are the saviour of our clan. Dharma is the most powerful of the 
gods. Invite his immediately."
<br>
While Gandhari was carrying for a year, Kunti invited Dharma by the power of the mantra. 
Kunti became pregnant by copulating with Dharma in the Shatashringa mountain peak. 
<br>
"This boy will be the best among the pious. He will say the  truth. He will rule the earth"
: the heaven announced while the baby was born. 
<br>
Kunti bore two more sons named Bheema and Arjun by inviing Vayu and Indra on Pandu;s request. 
<br>
Madri asked Pandu: "O king, Kunti is my sister wife. I am scared of her. But if you request her,
I too can bear a child."
<br>
Kunti agreed on Pandu's request. Madri invited Aswinikumar Duo. She had twins: Nakul and 
Sahadev. When Pandu asked Kunti for Madri for more sons, Kunti said: I asked Madri to
invite one god. But she cheated by inviting Aswinikumar Duo. Please do not request me 
further for Madri". 
<br>
Pandu's sons, begot by the gods, grew up to be handsome as moon, mightly as lions and  galmorous
as gods. One beautiful Spring afternoon, Pandu lost his restraint seeing Madri in private, took 
her by force. He died during intercourse because of the curse. 
<br>
Kunti arrived hearing Madri's cry. "I have always kept him under control. Why did you lure him?
But you are luckier. You have seen him charged. I am the senior wife. So, I will die with him.
You would raise the boys".
<br>
Madri said: "I am not yet satisfied in mating him, hence I will follow him. I can not treat
your three boys as my own. Better you raise my two sons as your own". Madri went to die with 
her husband.
