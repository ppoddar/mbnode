     After her marriage to Shantanu, <em>Satyavati</em> gave birth 
     to two sons: <em>Chitrangad</em> and
     <em>Bichitrobirya</em>. 
<br>
     Their father, <em>Shantanu</em>, passed
     away before younger Bichitrobirya reached his teen. 
     <em>Vishma</em> anointed Chitrangad as the emperor with Satyavati's consent. 
<br>
     Chitrangad was extraordinarily strong and considered everyone inferior be it human, god or  demon. 
<br>
 King of <em>Gandharva</em>, namesake to Chitrangad, challenged him to duel:
 "Both of us have the same name. Either fight me or take another name for yourself".
   <br>
 The duo met in a duel at <em>Kurukhestra</em>, 
 the mediation site of Kuru
 on the bank of river <em>Saraswati</em>. 
 <br>
 Chitrangad of Kuru clan was killed
 in the duel. 
   <p></p>
   
 So Vishma had to anoint adolescent Bichitrobirya to the throne. 
   <br>
 Vishma decided to get BichitroBirya married once he passed his teen. 
 When Vishma
 came to know that King of <em>Kashi</em> had organized aÂ 
 <span class="glossary">Swamvar</span>
 ceremony for his three beautiful daughters, 
 he rode his chariot to Kashi with permission
 from his step-mother, Satyavati. 
 
      
 <p></p>
 The kings from all over the land had assembled at the <em>Swamvar</em> 
ceremony at <em>Kashi</em>. 
 <br>
 During inauguration, when the assembled royals were announced, 
 the princesses recoiled at Vishma as he was aged and alone. 
      <br>
 The petty kings laughed at him: "What's the balding old hag doing here? 
 He calls himself a celibate! What a shameless clown! 
 He who can not keep his promise is despicable".
    <br>
  Angered, Vishma lifted all three princesses on his chariot. 
 He said in his baritone: "Listen
 all you rascal royals! There are many modes of marriage. 
 According to the wise men, the best
 way for a warrior is to elope the bride from her Swamvar 
 defeating other aspirants.
 I am taking these girls, Stop me if you can". 
      <br>
 The assembled royals, angry at the
 gauntlet, took off their designer clothes and jewelries, changed to battle gears,
 climbed on to their chariots and attacked Vishma. 
      <br>
   
 But even their combined might was no match against Vishma's fighting skills. 
      <br>
   
 As Vishma took off with three princesses leaving behind the defeated kings, 
 only <span class="glossary">Shalya</span>
 - another great warrior - chased him. 
 But Vishma destroyed Shalya's chariot, killing
 its horse and driver. 
      <br>
   
 Finally Vishma drove his chariot back to <em>Hastinapur</span>
 with threes princesses whom he treated with the same care and kindness accorded
 to one's daughter, younger sister or daughter-in-law. 
 <br>
 Vishma started preparing
 for marriage ceremony for all three princesses to<em>Bichitrobirya.</em>
 
<p></p>
 <em> Amba</em> - the eldest princess - told Vishma: 
 "I was ready to accept King Shalya as my husband at the Swamvar. He too desires me. 
 My father had given his consent for marriage. Oh, the wise, please follow your wisdom". 
      <br>
 After consultation with the <em>brahmins</em>, Vishma decided to send Amba back to Shalya. 
      <br>
   
 He continued the marriage arrangements for
 other two princesses - <em>Ambika</em> and 
 <em>Ambalika </em>.
      <br>
 After his marriage, Bichitrobirya immersed himself in carnal pleasure  with a pair
 of beautiful princesses . Within seven years, he contracted tuberculosis. He passed
 away slowly as a setting sun despite attempts by doctors and well-wishers.
