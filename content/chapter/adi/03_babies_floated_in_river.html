One day, young <span class="glossary">Shantanu</span> was roaming in the banks of river Ganga.
He noticed an exquisite woman in a golden dress.
Shantanu was enchanted by her. 
</p>

<p> 
 Shantanu approached her: "Oh my beauty, who are
 you? A goddess, or a mere mortal? Whoever you are, will you please marry me?". 
</p>

<p>    
 The lady replied:"I am Ganga. 
 I can be your wife. But on <em>one condition</em>. 
 You must not resist any of my actions, 
 be it good or evil.
 If you ever object, I will leave you ". 
</p>

<p>    
 Shantanu, enchanted by the mysterious
 woman, agreed. 
</p>

<hr>
<p>    
 Shantanu was happy with his charming and caring new wife. They together
 had eight babies, all boys, all handsome as angels. 
</p>

<p>    
 But every time, his wife threw
 the newborn into the river just after birth. Shantanu was irked by her strange
 act, but he did not resist. 
   </p>

<p> 
 Nevertheless, he could not help himself for the eighth newborn."Please
 do not throw the baby in the water": he pleaded to her. "Why
 do you reject the babies every time. Why?" 
</p>

<p> 
 His wife smiled: "You want a son, I know.
 I will not throw this newborn away to the river. But my days with you have now come to
 an end". 
</p>

<p> 
 Then she revealed her identity, told him about the curse of
