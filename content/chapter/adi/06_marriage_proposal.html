<em>Shantanu</em> returned to <em>Hastinapur</em>
with his newfound son <em>Debabrata</em>. 
Soon he anointed Debabrata as prince. Everyone liked
 the new young prince. 
   <br>
 Four years later, on one evening, Shantanu was strolling in
 the bank of river <em>Yamuna</em> when an intriguing perfume drew him in.
    <br>
 The scent drew him deep inside the woods in front of a young ravishing beauty. 
 Shantanu asked the girl who she is. 
 The girl said: "My name is <em>Satyavati</em>. My dad
 is the king of the fishermen. I row boats in Yamuna". 
 <br>
 Shantanu,smitten by Satyavati's beauty,
 visited her father <em>Dass</em> in fishermen's grove 
 and asked his daughter's hand for marriage. 
      <br>
 Dass said: "O King, I am honored by your offer. But
 you must promise the throne to her yet-to-be-born son". 
       <br>
    
 Shantanu could not make such a promise on the spot. 
 He returned to the palace, his mind occupied by a charming
 young face of a fragrant beauty. 
      <p></p>

 Debabrata noticed  pensive mood of his father for few weeks
 before asking: "O mighty king, peace reigns all over the kingdom. The borders are
 safe and secure from the enemies. Yet, why are you so worried? You don't ride the
 horses in the morning, nor you go for the evening stroll, you look pale and lost
 weight. What is eating you up?" 
      <br>
 Shantanu replied: "Oh my dear son, you are the
 <em>sole</em> heir to Bharath clan. 
 You are a great warrior, I know. But human life is tenuous. 
 God forbid, something happens to you, the great 
 bloodline of Bharatha will cease. 
 You worth more than hundred sons to me and that is why I do
 not wish to marry again. 
 But the wise says that a single son is no better than
 no son at all. This is what makes me worry". 
       <br>
    
 Debabrata sensed something more than
 continuing legacy of royal bloodline is bothering his old man. 
 So he consulted his
 father's chief secretary: "What's wrong with my father? 
 Why is he so pensive lately?"
 The chief secretary revealed the real cause. 
      <br>
 Debabrata immediately went to meet
 fisherman chief Dass with a group of senior statesmen. 
 He requested Dass on behalf of his father for Satyavati's
 hand in marriage. 
      <br>
   
 Dass received Debabrata with due respect but reiterated: 
 "O Prince, beloved of all, who would not be honored by such a proposal? My daughter,
 Satyavati is fit to be the queen of the great emperor Shantanu. 
 But <em>you</em>
 will be her future son's  step-brother. 
 Who could be happy to play second fiddle to a
 an all-rounder prince like you?" 
 <p></p>
 Debabrata replied: "Do not worry about that. I promise that the
 son born of wedlock of <em>Satyavati</em> and king <em>Shantanu</em>
 will become the future king of <em>Hastinapur</em>, not me". 
<br>
 King Dass said:"O great, gentle prince, you are the sole support of King Shantanu. Now you have
 become the savior of my daughter as well. You are so magnanimous that you deserve
 the right to give away the bride in this marriage. But as a father of the bride,
 I still have some concerns". 
<br>
 Willy Dass continued: "Everyone knows that you will
 never go back on your words. I too am not worried about that. 
 But it is your <em>unborn</em> son that I am afraid of". 
<br>
 Debabrata said: "I have already promised to relinquish
 the throne. Let me make a pledge: 
 <em>I will never father a child</em>. From
 now, I will be a celibate for ever. 
 I will attain heaven, despite being childless".
<br>
 King Dass and everyone was overwhelmed by Debabrata's pledge. Dass finally gave
 his consent for marriage.
<p></p>
 The gods were impressed as well. They rained flowers from  heaven.       
<br>
 They renamed Debabrata as <span class="glossary">Vishma</span> -
 one who accomplish nearly impossible tasks. 
 <br>    
 Having secured the consent from Dass, Vishma invited Satyavati to
 his chariot: "Mother, please get in. Let us go home". 
<br>
 They returned to Hastinapur and Vishma debriefed his father. 
 Everyone was full of praise of Debabrata, now
 Vishma, for his unprecedented pledge.
 <br>
  "He is truly Vishma. He has pledged what
 nobody ever did and perhaps ever will": they said. 
      <p></p>
 Shantanu - the happiest beneficiary of Vishma's
 pledge and elated with a new beautiful bride - blessed his son: 
  "My sinless dear son, you will live as long as you wish. 
  Death will not claim you until you wish to die".
