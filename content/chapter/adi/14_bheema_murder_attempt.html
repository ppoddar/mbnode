    The rishis went to Hastinapur with Kunti, the boys and the dead bodies of Pandu and Madi.
    Yudhistir was sixteen, Bheem fifteen, Anrjun fourteen and Nakul,Sahadev were thirteen at the time.
    The Kauravs received the rishis with due respect at the court. The wiseest and eldest among the rishis
    described the death of Pandu and introduced Yudhisthir and his brothers. Then the  rishis left.

    Dhritarashtra asked Vidur to observe the final rites of Pandu and Madri. The rites were completed
    on the thirteenth day, and everybody returned to the palace with broken heart. Then Vyaas told to 
    grief-stricken Satyavati: "Mama. The happy days have come to an end. The world is beyond its youth.
    Slowly the sins will increase. All goodness will disappear on the Kauravas deeds. You should retire
    rather than observe the decay of the Kuru clan" 
    <br>
    Satyavati informed the words of Vyaas to her daughter-in-laws Ambika and  Ambalika. Then all three
    retired to the forest and left their body for heaven after  mediation.
    <br>
    Pandavas stayed happily in their father's palace. Bheem used to be the best in the sports. He 
    used to bully the sons of Dhritarashta. He used to bang their heads, plunged them in water and 
    bullied them in many other ways. Nobody can beat Bheem in wrestling, running or body budilding.
    Bheem had no ill intent, but still the boys of Dhritarashta hated him for his bullying.

    Duryadhan built an well-appointed house named Udakkriyan at Pramankoti on Ganga's bank. 
    He arranged a buffet and invited the Pandavas to the house.  Everybody playfully stuffed
    food to others. Duryadhon used that opportunity to feed food to Bheema laced with Kalkut poison.
    Everyoe went to rest after lunch and watersport. But Bheema felt terribly tired, laid down
    the Ganga's bank senseless under the influence of the strong poison. Duryadhan tied him 
    with the creepers and threw him in the water.
    <br>
    Senseless Bheema thrown in the water reached the SnakeLand. The mighty snakes 
    bit him. The poison nullifed Kalkut. Bheem came back to the senses and started kiiling 
    the snakes. The snakes informed Basuki. Basuki came and could recogize Bheem as his grandson 
    - the son Kunti - the daughter of Kuntibhoj - the son of his daughter. 
    Basuki embraced Bheem and asked: "Entertain him. Please him with jeweles".
    One of the serpent said: "Wht use are the jewels? If you are pleased with him, offer 
    him to drink the potion". 
    <br>
    The serpants took Bheema to the jars of potion on Basuki's command. Bheema purified 
    himself, sat facing east and drank potion from eight jar finishing each in a single shot. 
    Then he slept happily on the bed offered by the serpant.
    <br>
    The kauravas and pandavs could not locate Bheema after the watersport. THey returned 
    to Hastinapur in their chariots or horses or elephants thinking that Bheema might have 
    returned earlier.  
    <br>
    Kunti got worried by Bheema's absence. Vidurm Yudhisthir also could not locate Bheema 
    anywhere in the palace or its gardens. Kunti suspected that cruel Duryadhan might have
    killed Bheema. Vidur calmed her: "Your sons will live long according to the great saint Vyaas".
    <br>
    Bheema woke up on the eighth day. The serpants told him: "You have digested the potions.
    Now you are strong as many elephants. Shower  and return home."
    Bheem showered, had a good meal, took the blessings of the serpants and returned home.
    <br>
    Yudhisthir learned the whole episode and told: "Keep shut. Do not discuss the events.
    We stay cautious from now on." Duryadhan, having failed on his attempt on Bheema, stayed 
    morose.  
    <br>
    Dhritarashta appointed Kripacharya of Gautama clan as the trainer of the princes.
