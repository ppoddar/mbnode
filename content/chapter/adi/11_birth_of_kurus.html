	In due course of time,<em>Ambika</em> gave birth to a blind boy, 
	<span class="glossary">Dhritarashtra</span>. Her sister
	<em>Ambalika</span> bore an albino boy, <span class="glossary">Pandu</span>.
<p></p>
	After Ambika started menstruating again, Satyavati asked her
	to mate Vyaas once more, but she could not because
	she still remembered his ugly face, stinking body odor.
	Instead she sent one of her <em>shudra</em> chambermaids to Vyaas.
	<br>
	The maid bore <span class="glossary">Bidur</span>.
	<br>
	Vyaas was pleased with the beautiful maid and the way she cared for him. Afterward he
	told her: "O good-natured woman, you will no more be a serf. Your son
	will be pious and smart". Bidur was a reincarnation of 
	<span class="glossary">Dharma</span> - the god of Justice.

<div class="story">
	<span class="glossary">Mandavya</span>
		was a silent monk who always held his hand straight above his head. Once some thieves
		stashed their loot in Mandavya's temple. The police came to the temple and questioned
		Mandavya. But Mandavya did not speak.
	<br>
		Later when police caught the thieves, the
		police also arrested Mandavya as an accomplice and produced them to the royal court.
	<br>
		The king sentenced all the accused to <em>death-by-spear</em>.
		Each culprit was placed on top of
		a spear until death. But Mandavya remained alive because of his meditative power.
	<br>
		When the king realized that Mandavya was a monk and not a thief, he was brought
		down, but the spearhead stayed inside his body.
	
	<br>
		Once Mandavya met Dharma and asked him: "Why did you punish me so harshly? What did
		I do wrong?"
	<br>
		Dharma said: "You inserted a blade of grass in a grasshopper's
		ass when you were a kid. Your punishment is a result of that cruel act".
	<br>
		"Dharma, you have punished me way out of proportion. Killing a
		<em>brahmin</em> is far more critical than
		killing any other form of life. I curse you that someday you will be born as a lowly
		<em>shudra</em>.
		Also I proclaim that any guilty act will be adjudged juvenile
		crime before the age of fourteen.""
	<br>
	It was on Oni Mandavya's curse, Dharma was born as Bidur
	of a <em>shudra</em> chambermaid.

<p></p>
	Vishma raised Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Bidur as if his own children. 
	Dhritarashtra grew extraordinarily
	strong, Pandu mastered archery and Bidur was exceptionally pious.
<br>
	Pandu was the heir to the throne because Dhritarashta was blind and Bidur was a <em>shudra</em>.

<br>
	Vishma, in consultation with Bidur, arranged Dhritarashtra's marriage to
	<span class="glossary">Gandhari</span>- the daughter of 
	<em>Subol</em> - the king of <em>Gandhar</span>.
<br>
	After her marriage to a blind man, Gandhari covered
	her eyes with a black bandage. She did not want to supersede her husband by any
	means.
<p></p>
<hr>
	<em>Shur</em> was <em>Basudev</em>'s father and the leader of <em>Yadu</em>clan.
	Shur had a daughter, named <span class="glossary">Prithwa</span>.
<br>
	Shur donated Prithwa to his nephew, king <em>KuntiBhoj</em>,
	who was childless. Prithwa became known as
	<span class="glossary">Kunti</span> after her adopted father.
<br>
	Once saint <em>Durbasha</em>was a house guest at KuntiBhoj's palace.
	Kunti looked after Saint and took good care of him.
	Durbasha was pleased and taught her a <em>mantra</em>.
	<br>
	"You can invite any god by this mantra. He can beget you a son": Durbasha
	told Kunti.
	<p></p>
<hr>
	Curious, young Kunti invited <em>Surya</em>
	- the Sun god. Surya appeared and asked her: "O cat-eyed girl, what do you want?"
<br>
	Kunti told him about Durbasha's mantra and apologized for her indiscretion.
<br>
	Surya assured her:"Your invitation would not go waste. 
	You will beget my son. But you will remain a virgin".
<br>
	Kunti gave birth to an angelic son who was born with a body
	armor and ear-ring of a warrior. This firstborn of Kunti would later become
	famous as a great warrior <span class="glossary">Karna</span>.
<br>
	But Kunti, because she was unwed, was ashamed. She secretly
	floated the newborn in the river on a pot.
	<em>Adhirath</em> and <em>Radha</span>- a childless<em>suta</em>
	couple - found the baby floating in the river inside a pot and took the baby home.
	They adopted the baby and named him
	<em>BasuSen</em>.
<br>
	BasuSen or Karna, as
	he would be known later, learned to handle all kinds of weapons as he grew up. Karna
	used to worship the sun till noon.
<br>
	One day,<em>Indra</span>
	- the god of the gods - came to him disguised as a brahmin.
	Indra asked Karna for his body armor.
	Karna took off the armor and gave it away.
	Indra pleased by the generous gesture donated Karna the
	<em>Shakti Ashtra</span>
	- a weapon that never failed to
	kill the target and always returned to its owner.
<p></p>
<hr>
	KuntiBhoj organized <em>Swamvar</em>
	for her adopted daughter Kunti. Kunti chose
	<em>Pandu</span>as her husband at swambar.
<br>
	Vishma wanted another wife for Pandu. So Vishma went to King
	<em>Shalya</span> and asked for his sister's hand in marriage.
	<br>
	Shalya said: "You must be aware
	of one of our customs. I can not ignore the customs, whether they are good or bad".
	<br>
	"There is no harm in following the customs": Vishma replied.
	<br>
	Hence, Vishma offered Shalya
	the dowry of gold, gems, elephants, horses.
	Shalya was pleased and offered his sister
	<em>Madri</em> for marriage.
	<br>
	Vishma brought Madri to Hastinapur and married her to Pandu.

<br>
	Shudra wife of King
	<span class="glossary">Debak</span>
	had a daughter from a bramhin's
	seed. Bidur was married to her.
<p></p>
<hr>
Vyaas had foretold that Dhritarashtra would sire hundred sons. 
However, his wife Gandhari became pregnant
but she did not deliver in two years. 
She grew even more impatient and jealous when 
she came to know that Kunti had given birth to Yudhisthira. 
<br>
Gandhari aborted with Dhritarashtra's consent. 
A piece of meat as hard as iron came out of her womb. 
She was dumping the piece of meat when Vyaas appeared and said: "My
prophecy will not fail. Soak this meat in cold water". 
<br>
Gandhari soaked the meat and it soon grew into hundreds
of small finger-like spores. She kept each spore in separate
pitcher submerged in butter. After a year, <span class="glossary">Duryodhan</span> was
born from one of the pitchers. 
<br>
Duryodhan roared like a donkey as soon as he was born.
Also vultures, jackals and ravens cried and many other omens were observed. 
<br>
Noticing the omens, Bidur and Bramhins advised: "Your son will ruin the clan,
better to abandon him now." 
<br>
But  Dhritarashtra could not abandon his firstborn. Within another month, 
hundred other sons - DuhShashan, DuhShah
etcetera and a daughter - DuhShala were born.
<br>
Instead, Dhritarashtra was worried for Duryadhan's prsopect and asked Vishma:
"Yudhisthira is the eldest and heir to the throne, but after him, will my son
be the king?"
<p></p>
A prostitute used to take care of Dhritarashtra during Gandhari's pregnency,
She too bore a son -- Yuyutsu.
