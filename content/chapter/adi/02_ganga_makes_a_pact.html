<title>Ganga Makes a Pact</title>

<p>
King <span class="glossary">Prateep</span> was meditating at the riverbank while  
<span class="glossary">Ganga</span>
 – the beautiful deity of the river – emerged from water and sat on king's lap.
</p>

<p>   
 King Prateep asked: "Oh beautiful lady, what do you want?" 
</p>

<p>   
 "You, O the mightiest
 of the Kurus! I want <em>you</em>": Ganga replied. 
</p>

<p>      
 "I am an emperor. Not available
 for just <em>anybody</em>": Prateep did not show much 
 interest in her.
 </p>

<p>     
 "I am Ganga – the river goddess. Not just <em>anybody</em>": 
 Ganga said. 
</p>

<p>   
 The king said: "Ganga! You sat on my <em>right</em> thigh -- 
 place for children or daughter-in-laws.
 Why don't you be my daughter-in-law?". 
</p>

<p>      
 Ganga said: "I would be happy to be your
 daughter-in-law. But your son must not deny <em>whatever</em> I do."

<p>      
 Prateep and his wife had been trying for a baby.
</p>

<p>   
 King Mahavish who had been 
 <link linkend="banished_from_heaven">banished from heaven</link> by Brahma 
  was born as their son. 
  His name was <span class="glossary">Shantanu</span>.
  
</p>

<p> 
  
 When Shantanu grew up, Prateep told him: "Son, before your birth, a beautiful lady
 came to me once. She agreed to be your woman. If she comes to you ever again, please fulfill
 her wish. But remember: never deny whatever she does. That was our pact". 
   </p>

<p> 
 Soon afterward
 Prateep relinquished the throne for Shantanu and retired to the forest.
