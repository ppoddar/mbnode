    Saint Gautam had a pupil: Sharadwan. Sharwadan was better at archery than at the 
    study of the Vedas. Indra was apprehensive of his tapasya and sent an apsara Janapdi.
    Sharadwan saw Janapati, the bows and arrows fell from his hand and he ejaculated.   
    The semen fell on a shsarastambha, split into two and two baibes were  born: a boy
    and a girl. King Shantanu found them and brought them home. He named the boy Kripa 
    and the girl, Kripi. 
    <br>
    Sharadwan came to know of the babies by his mediative power. He came to Shantanu's 
    palace and trained Kripa to master archery. 
    <br>
    Yudhisthir, Duryadhan and prince of Brish clan and princes from other clans were
    training under Kripa.

    Saint Varadwaj lived in Gangtori province. One day, he ejaculated while he 
    saw apsara Ghritachi. He kept the semen in a pot. Drona was born from that semen.
    Saint Agibeshya taught Drona of firearms. Prishit - the kng of Panchal - was a friend 
    to Varadwaj. Drupad - Prishit's son - used to play with Drona. 
    <br>
    Drona married Kripi on his father's order. They had a son who cried like a horse 
    on his birth. He was named Ashwathama.
    <br>
    After Varadwaj's death, Drona continued the arms training from his campus. One day he 
    came to know that Parashuram - the son of Vrigu, the best arms trainner -  is giving
    away all his wealth to the bramhins. Drona met Parashuram at Mahenda mountains, and 
    asked for wealth. Parashuram said: I have given away all my gold, have gave the world 
    to Kashyap, now I have only the arms and my body. What do you want?"
    <br>
    Drona said: "Please give me the arms and teach me the rules of their usage and withdrawal".
    Parashuram satisfied Drona's wish. 
    <br>
    Drona was pleased. He went to Drupad - the king of Panchal. But Drupad, proud with his
    royal wealth, humilated his childhood friend. Drone was consumed by rage. He took 
    shelter at Kripa's place in Hastinapur and stayed there.   
    <br>
    Once, the princes were playing with a ball outside the city limits. Suddenly the ball 
    fell into a dried up well. The prices could not retrieve the ball after many attempts. 
    <br>
    A dusky, white-haired bramhin was sitting near by. The princes approached him. Drona was the 
    bramhin. He laughed at them: "Phew! You are born in Bharata's clan, were trained in 
    arms. But you can not even retrieve a ball from a well. I will retrieve the ball 
    and my ring by the blade of grass. But you must treat me."
    <br>
    Yudhisthir said: "You will be receive food everyday if Kripa permits". Drona threw 
    his ring into the well. He pierced the ball with a blade of grass. Then pierced 
    the first blade of grass witg another blade of grass. He made a chain of blade 
    of grass. Then he pulled the ball out of the well by the chain of grass. 
    <br>
    The princes were surprised at hos skill: "Oh master! Please pull out your ring too."
    Drona pulled out the ring from the well similarly.  The princes asked Drona about his 
    identity. "You have seen my skill. Go! Tell Bhisma about me." 
    <br>
    Vishma heard the episode and recognized that the bramhin is indeed Drona and he is 
    fit to the teacher of the princes. Vishma invited Drona with due respect. Drona said:"
    Drupad - prince of Panchal - and I were trained on arms with Agibesh. Drupad and I were 
    friends since childhood. Drupad told me at the end of trainning that he is the most 
    favourite son of his father. When he acquires the throne of Panchal, I will also  
    own Panchal. I rembered his words. The I married on my father;s order and wish for
    a son. My wife has thin hair bit she is pious and helps me in everything. My son Ashwathama
    is very bright. Once Ashwathama saw the rich kids drining milk. He came to crying. I  
    tried a lot, but could not afford a milking cow by honest means. Ashwathama's friends 
    fed him mixture of chalk. Ashwathama thought it to be milk. He danced in joy. The boys 
    laughed at me, and said:"Shame on poor, wretched Drona. He can not earn. His son 
    dances in joy by drinking chalk mixture as milk. I lost me mind, went to Drupad 
    remembering past friendship. I addressed his as frind. Drupad said: Oh bramhin. You 
    are uncouth. That is why you are addressing me as friend. Only equals can be friends. 
    Bramhin and non-Bramhin, warrior and non-warrior, mighty king and asssetless poor 
    - they can not be friends. Will given you food for tonight; take it and leave".
    <br>
    Drona said: "I was humilate. I swore revenge. I came to the kingdom of Kuru. Now Bhisma
    tell me what duty do you want me to do."
    <br>
    Bhisma said: "Open your bow. Teach the princes. Stay here with dignity and enjoy the spoils.
    You are the boss, the Kauravas will obey you".
    <br>
    Drona said:"Kripa will be hurt if I take over. Instead offer me some asset.Let me leave."
    <br>
    Bhisma said: "Kripacharya will also stay. We will pay our respect and for his upkeep also.
    You will become the chief trainner of our grandsons."
    <br>
    Bhisma arranged for a clean home full with food for Drona and his Family. He gave Drona 
    the responsibility of the princes' training.  
    <br>
    The princes of Brshni and Andhak clan and the princes from other clans joined Drona
    for trainning. Karna also took him to be his master. Arjuna beame the most favourite
    among the students of Dronacharya.  
    <br>
    Ekalavya - son of Hiraynadhanu - king of Nishad - also came to Drona for trainning. 
    But Drona did not accept him because his low caste. Ekalavya touched Drona's feet 
    by his forehead and went to the forest. He made a idol of Drona and practiced arms 
    on his own
