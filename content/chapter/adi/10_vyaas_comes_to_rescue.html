		Satyavati smiled at Vishma's suggestion.
		She then revealed her own past.
	<br>
		She herself had a baby before her marriage. "His name was
		<em>Dwiypaayan</em>":she said.
	<br>"He is a great scholar, a great saint, I hear": 
		she continued about her
		son: "They titled him <em>Vyaas</em>
		because he had classified the Vedas into four categories.
		He is dark. Hence his other name is <em>Krishna</em>.
		He lives with his father:<em>Parashar</em>.

		But he told me that he will always be there for me".
	<br>
		Vishma, on our request,
		<em>Krishna Dwiypaayan Vyaas</em>
		will be ready to impregnate his sister-in-laws".
	<br>
		Vishma agreed to Satyavati suggestion.
	<br>
		As soon as Satyavati recalled him, Vyaas arrived in
		<em>HastinaPur</em>.
		Satyavati embraced her son, soaked him with milk from her breast and cried.
	<br>
		Vyaassaid: "Your wish is my command, Mama. 
		Please tell me what do you wish?"
	<br>
		After listening to Satyavati's request, Vyaas said: 
		"I will carry it out only because of you. 
		Let the princesses
		be pure following the practices I suggest. 
		It will take an year. Then they may sleep with me".
	<br>
		Satyavati told her son: "<em>One whole year</em>?
		That will not do. It does not rain in a land that has no ruler. 
		The gods are not
		pleased with a land without a king. So no! we can not wait for an year.
		Make the princesses pregnant
		as soon as possible. Vishma will take care of the babies".
	<br>
		Vyaas
		told his mother "I am dark and ugly. My body stinks. 
		My rags are filthy. If it needs to
		be immediate, the princesses must endure all that".
	<br>
		Satyavati had to cajole the princesses to meet with Vyaas.
	<hr>
		<em>Ambika</em>
		entered the bed chamber. But, while waiting
		for Vyaas, she fantasized Vishma and other mighty warriors. 
	<br>
		After a while, Vyaas entered the bed chamber. 
		She was scared looking at Vyaas - his darkness, his burning
		eyes and long gray-black hairs in deep knots heaped on a serpentine pile over his
		head. She closed her eyes in fear...
	<br>
		After Vyaas came out of the bed chamber finishing
		his duty, Satyavati asked him: "Will the child be worthy of a king?"
	<br>

		Vyaas said:
		"Mama, he will be strong as hundred elephants, learned and intelligent and he will father
		hundred sons. But... he will be blind. It's because of his mother".
	<p></p>
		Satyavati was not pleased. She said: "A blind man is not fit to be
		the emperor of Kuru clan. You must give them another son".
	<br>
		Next, <em>Ambalika</em>- the other princess - entered the bed chamber.
		But she tuned pale once she saw Vyaas.
	<br>
		Later, Vyaas told Satyavati:
		"This son will be powerful, charismatic and sire five sons. But... he will be an
		albino. It's because of his mother".
