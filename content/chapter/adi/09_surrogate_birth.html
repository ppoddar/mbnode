Despite losing her sons,  <em>Satyavati</em> consoled widowed daughter-in-laws.
 She commanded <em>Vishma</em>: "You have to bear the torch of 
 King <em>Shantanu</em> now. You know theology and are aware of the tradition of our clan. 
 On my permission either you impregnate your sister-in-laws or take the throne yourself and marry.
 In any case, do not let your forefathers rot in hell". 
   <br>
 Vishma said: "Mother, I can
 sacrifice everything on earth, heaven and hell. But I can not break my pledge. I
 have a plan to keep our bloodline going forward".
    <br>
  Vishma told Satyavati ancient practice of surrogate birth. 
 
 <div class="story">
 In olden days, when <em>YamadAgnya Parashuram</em> annihilated the 
 entire warrior clan, the women of the
 warriors got pregnant with the Vedic brahmins, because Veda dictates that
 son begot by a surrogate sperm belongs to the married couple.
   <br>
 Once Saint <em>Brihashpati</em> approached 
 <em>Mamata</em>
 - his pregnant sister-in-law, wife of Saint <em>Utathya</em>. 
 But Mamata
 was not willing to sleep with Brihashpati. 
 Brihashpati attempted to rape her and tried to enter her by force. 
 
      <br>
 The unborn baby in Mamata's womb stopped his uncle's entry with
 his small feet. Angry BrihashPati cursed the unborn baby: "You will be blind". 
      <br>
 Utathya's son was born blind. He was named <em>Dirghatma</em>. 
      <br>
 DirghaAtma took to Bovinism - a practice to mate anywhere anytime like animals.
    <br> 
 The other priests were enraged at Dirghatma's bovinism. They exiled him and Dirghaatma's sons
 floated him on a raft at their mother's command. 
      <br>
 King <em>Bali</em> found
 the floating raft and took Dirghatma home. 
 The king wanted Dirghatma to be the biological father of his children. 
 
      <br>
 King asked his wife, <em>Sudeshna</em>,
 to sleep with Dirghatama. But Sudeshna did not like  blind Dirghatama and sent
 her maid instead. 
      <br>
 The maid - a low-caste, <em>shudra</em> woman - bore eleven children
 who grew up to be priests. 
 
       <br>
 King Bali, however, kept insisting his wife. Finally Sudeshna
 herself went to Dirghatama. Dirghatama touched her skin and said: "You will bear
 five mighty sons: <em>Aanga</em>, <em>Banga</em>, 
 <em>Kalinga</em>,
 <em>Pundra</em> and <em>Suksha</em>. 
 Each will rule a region after their own name. 
    <br>
 That is the way the Bali dynasty was originated from Dirghatma seed.

 Then Vishma said: "Mother, let us employ a talented 
 <em>brahmin</em> to impregnate late Bichitrobirya's wives".
